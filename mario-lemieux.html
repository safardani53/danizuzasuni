Lemieux is a brilliant playmaker and fast skater who uses fakes and dekes to beat defensemen despite his stature.&nbsp;</p><p>The Canadian-born is widely known as one of the greatest players of all time, with nicknames such as “The Magnificent One,” “Le Magnifique,” and “Super Mario.”</p><p>Mario was the first overall pick in the NHL Entry Draft in 1984. Moreover, he led the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cup titles in 1991 and 1992.</p><p>The Penguins won more championships under his ownership in 2009, 2016, and 2017. In addition, he is the only person whose name appears on the Cup as both a player and an owner.&nbsp;</p><p>Lemieux led Team Canada to an Olympic gold medal in 2002, a World Cup victory in 2004, and a Canada Cup in 1987.</p><h2>Early Life&nbsp;</h2><p>Jean-Guy Lemieux, an engineer, and Pierrette, a stay-at-home mom, raised Lemieux in Montreal. In the Ville-Émard area, he and his older brothers Alain and Richard grew up in a working-class family.</p><p>Mario began playing hockey in his basement when he was three years old. He used wooden kitchen spoons as hockey sticks and bottle caps as pucks before purchasing proper equipment.</p><p>His father built a rink on the front lawn so the brothers could practice as much as possible. Their family tradition is that the family would sometimes pack snow onto the living room carpet so the boys could practice indoors when it was dark.</p><p>Lemieux began his career with the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League’s Laval Voisins (QMJHL). He vowed when he was drafted at the age of 15 that he would set league records.</p><p>During the 1983–84 QMJHL season, he asked coach Jean Bégin to put him on a front line with Jacques Goyette. Lemieux surpassed the league record for points in a season with 282 (133 goals, 149 assists) in 70 games, proving that the combination worked.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>The Pittsburgh Penguins selected Lemieux in the 1984 Entry Draft because they needed a natural goal scorer to boost their fortunes after finishing dead the last two seasons.</p><p>He participated in the NHL All-Star Game and was named the game’s Most Valuable Player for the first time. In 1984-85, he earned the Calder Memorial Trophy as the best rookie.</p><p>In 1989, his second five-goal performance was vital in a 10-7 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. He tied for the most goals and points in a playoff game in NHL history, but the Penguins lost the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mario-Lemieux-1024x1024.jpg><p>Lemieux missed 50 games in the 1990–91 NHL season due to surgery for a herniated disk but returned to guide the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup victory over the Minnesota North Stars.</p><p>The athlete scored his 600th career goal in his 719th game in the 1996-97 season, trailing <a href=#>Wayne Gretzky’s</a> 600 goals in 718 games.

The players are chosen by the captains of the teams and NHL officials by ballot.</p><p>In the 1987 Canada Cup, he set a tournament record by scoring 11 goals in nine games, the last of which was a last-minute goal that clinched the tie against the Soviet Union.</p><p>One of the best individual performances in NHL history, he scored a goal in each of the five conceivable game situations in the same game against the New Jersey Devils in 1988.</p><h2>Diagnosed with Cancer&nbsp;</h2><p>To clarify, Hodgkin’s disease, cancer of the lymph nodes, was discovered in Lemieux. Despite the diagnosis, Lemieux intended to rejoin the squad within ten weeks of his injury.</p><p>After a round of radiation therapy, he was back with the Penguins in March. In his first game back, he had a goal and an assist. The team then went on to win 15 games in a row.</p><p>Despite the expectations, Lemieux only appeared in 22 games in the following two seasons.

Despite winning his sixth scoring championship in the 1996-97 season, he decided to retire while still at the pinnacle of his game.</p><p>He had two reasons for this.
