Dillon Brooks</h3><p>The Grizzlies forward, Dillon Brooks, has been in the spotlight due to some noteworthy incidents throughout this season.</p><p>Brooks has been making headlines all season, particularly regarding his ongoing feud with <a href=#>Draymond Green</a> and <a href=#>Klay Thompson</a> of the Warriors.&nbsp;</p><p>In Game 2 of the 2022 Western Conference semifinals against the Warriors, Brooks was assessed a flagrant two and ejected from the court after he chased down the Dubs’ Gary Payton II and hit him in the head when he was in the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dillon-Brooks.jpg><p>Similarly, he was ejected on February 2, 2023, after punching Cavs player&nbsp;<a href=#>Donovan Mitchell</a>&nbsp;in the groin.</p><p>On March 17, NBA fined Brooks $35k after he shoved a cameraman to the floor during a game against the Heat.</p><p>Brooks is not necessarily universally hated, but he has gained a reputation for being a controversial figure on the basketball court.</p><p>Some fans and critics view him as an aggressive player who crosses the line between physical play and unsportsmanlike conduct.</p><h3>12. Patrick Beverley</h3><p>Number 12 on our list of the most hated basketball players is 35 year-old Patrick Beverley. He currently plays for the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>In 2008, Beverley first played for the Ukrainian professional basketball team, Dnipro.

So then, why is he among the most hated players?</p><p>Green is an emotional player and is criticized for his highly physical play.</p><p>Consequently, he has been in multiple high-profile incidents during playoffs. Similarly, he is infamous for playing dirty and frequently performing technical fouls.</p><h3>10. Rasheed Wallace</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Rasheed Wallace</a> is a former basketball player and our tenth-most-hated basketball player.</p><p>The 49 year-old started his professional career playing for the Washington Bullets in 1995.</p><p>Wallace forwent his remaining college year to enter the 1995 NBA Draft and was selected by the Bullets.</p><p>From 1995 to 2013, Wallace was signed by other NBA teams; Portland Trail Blazers, Atlanta Hawks, Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, and New York Knicks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rasheed-Wallace.jpg><p>Often on the court, Wallace was known for his intense style of playing. He was very expressive and frequently confronted opponent players and officials.</p><p>Similarly, he was also often involved in technical fouls and ejections.
